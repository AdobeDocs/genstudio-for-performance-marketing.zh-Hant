# Documentation Linting Process

This rule defines the process for running and fixing linting issues in documentation files.

## Process Steps

1. Run the linter:

   ```sh
   yarn lint
   ```

2. If the linter fails because Docker is not running, ask the user if they would like to continue (Y/N) before proceeding. Only continue if the user confirms.

3. Review the output for markdown linting errors. Common issues include:
   - MD047/single-trailing-newline: Missing newline at end of file
   - MD009/no-trailing-spaces: Trailing spaces in lines
   - MD012/no-multiple-blanks: Multiple consecutive blank lines
   - MD013/line-length: Lines exceeding maximum length
   - MD041/first-line-heading: Missing heading at start of file
   - MD022/headings: Headings not following sentence case

4. Fix identified issues:
   - For missing newlines: Add a newline at the end of the file using:

     ```sh
     echo "" >> <file_path>
     ```

   - For trailing spaces: Remove trailing spaces using:

     ```sh
     sed -i '' 's/ $//' <file_path>
     ```

   - For multiple blank lines (MD012): Remove extra blank lines, especially at end of file:

     ```sh
     sed -i '' '$ { /^$/d; }' <file_path>
     ```

   - For heading case issues: Ensure headings follow sentence case (first word capitalized, rest lowercase)
   - For line length issues: Break long lines at appropriate points
   - For missing headings: Add appropriate heading at start of file

5. Verify fixes:

   ```sh
   yarn lint
   ```

## Common Fixes

### Adding Missing Newlines

When a file is missing a newline at the end (MD047), use:

```sh
echo "" >> <file_path>
```

### Removing Trailing Spaces

When a file has trailing spaces (MD009), use:

```sh
sed -i '' 's/ $//' <file_path>
```

### Removing Extra Blank Lines at End of File

When a file has multiple blank lines at the end (MD012), especially stray lines:

```sh
sed -i '' '$ { /^$/d; }' <file_path>
```

### Fixing Multiple Issues

To fix both trailing spaces and add a newline:

```sh
sed -i '' 's/ $//' <file_path> && echo "" >> <file_path>
```

To fix trailing spaces, remove extra blank lines, and ensure proper newline:

```sh
sed -i '' 's/ $//' <file_path> && sed -i '' '$ { /^$/d; }' <file_path> && echo "" >> <file_path>
```

## Notes

- The linter may show warnings in YAML files about missing document start markers (`---`) and line length. These are not critical errors.
- Some files may have platform-specific warnings (e.g., platform mismatch) which can be safely ignored.
- The linter exits with code 0 when `DISABLE_ERRORS` is set to true, even if there are warnings.
- Always verify fixes by running the linter again after making changes.
- **Common Issue**: Files often have stray blank lines at the very end that cause MD012 errors. The `sed -i '' '$ { /^$/d; }'` command specifically targets the last line if it's blank, which is the most common cause of this error.

## Checklist

- [ ] Run `yarn lint`
- [ ] If Docker is not running and the linter fails, ask the user if they would like to continue (Y/N)
- [ ] Review and document all linting errors
- [ ] Fix each identified issue
- [ ] Run `yarn lint` again to verify fixes
- [ ] Document any remaining warnings that are acceptable to ignore
